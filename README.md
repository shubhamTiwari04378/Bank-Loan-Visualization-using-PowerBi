## Problem Statement
The current loan data analysis approach lacks the depth and interactivity needed to derive meaningful insights for informed decision-making. Traditional reporting methods fail to provide a comprehensive view of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics. There is a pressing need to develop advanced, interactive dashboards that will unlock the full potential of our loan data.

## Objective
Our objective is to craft a suite of interconnected, dynamic dashboards that offer comprehensive insights into loan data. These dashboards will empower decision-makers by providing a holistic perspective on lending operations, borrower demographics, loan performance, and financial metrics, facilitating data-driven strategic decision-making.

## Dashboard Breakdown

### 1. **Executive Summary Dashboard**
**Purpose:**  
This dashboard provides a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) critical for evaluating the overall efficiency and performance of lending activities.

**Key Features:**
- **Total Loan Applications:** Monitor total and Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, along with Month-over-Month (MoM) trends for actionable insights.
- **Total Funded Amount:** Track total disbursed funds, MTD disbursements, and MoM variations to identify funding patterns.
- **Total Amount Received:** Evaluate total and MTD received amounts from borrowers, assessing MoM fluctuations for financial health insights.
- **Average Interest Rate:** Track the average interest rate across all loans, including MTD and MoM changes.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Measure financial resilience by calculating the average DTI for all loans, with MTD and MoM changes.

**Loan Performance Analysis:**
- Classify loans into “Good” and “Bad” categories based on specific KPIs.
- Implement a "Loan Status Grid View" for categorizing loan status, providing detailed insights for data-driven decisions.
